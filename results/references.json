.\nFor example, we need just as much sleep as we get older .\nThe problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep .\nWhen the short-term memory starts to go, it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day, such as whether they've had breakfast, or showered, or spoken to someone.\nIt can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day. Writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes, which can help slow down future decline.\nCreate a memory hub - that is, a central place in the home, perhaps the dining room table or a desk, where important notes, car keys, house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept. Put things here that you want to be able to find quickly. Get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home.\nGet a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week. Things that get done can be ticked off. It is another way to show what has been done, but also shows what remains to be done.\nLabel doors, drawers, cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where.\nHave a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your GP and other care professionals, carers, family and reliable friends.\nHave a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day's date.\nWhen showering or having a bath, establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed. For example, move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you've used them.\nEat regular meals. While other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere, the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood. That's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning, cognition and memory.\nIn the early stages of dementia, begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person's life and who people are. It's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together. Include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry.", "Twiglet the bedlington lurcher had a bad trip after accidentally eating drugs .\nHe found the narcotics lying on the ground near the village bus stop .\nTwiglet's symptoms included hallucinating, seizures and hyper salivating .\nHis owner is urging pet owners to be careful about what their dogs pick up .", "Clegg tells pupils he was better at languages and art as a youngster .\nLib Dem manifesto to promise to eradicate the deficit 'fairly' by 2019 .\nClegg's wife Miriam says her priority is making sure their sons are 'OK'", "Cui Hongfang hit the back of her head on a corner of the stone wall .\nPolice have ruled it an accident, but are still investigating .\nVictim's family said the tourist was running on a steep section of the wall .", "Sarah Harper was dating Christopher Lane, 22, when he was gunned down .\nChancey Allen Luna has been accused of killing sportsman in August 2013 .\nHe was visiting Harper in the city of Duncan when he was slain .\nThe Melbourne, Australia, native was on a baseball scholarship at the time .\nProsecutors also said 104 bullets were discovered in the drive-by car .", "An earlier version of this article wrongly referred to Erith and Thamesmead's Conservative parliamentary candidate Mrs Anna Firth posting pictures of litter in Bromley to shame her political opponent.
